# Weather-App

This is a web app I built to show a user's current weather.

It requests the user's location and then uses that data to create an API call using the acquired latitude and longitude. It also displays a short weather discription and related icon.

I built it mainly using jQuery although now I prefer using JavaScript, utilizing ES6 features.
